datapreparation.py
===================

is only there for revision purposes. Not playing a role in the finla process. Its process is splitted in the two following files

preparation_step0
=================

gathers data from the cocodataset in the PublicDatasetsFolder
'/home/carlos/PycharmProjects/PublicDatasets/Coco/'
 concretely annotations, and since the images are annotated on a entry per person and image (hence multiple entries may refer to a single image), we aggregate all the entries on a
 per-image basis, since the finla net will have to manage accordingly: several person entries per image
Annotations are stored in train.json and val.json in the root folder

verification_step0
====================

It merely displays each image with its associated bounding boxes (one per person) and keypoints inside each bbox. Just for verification that the previous step is correct.

SL_Fields
=========
contains function to create S and L fields for an image and its annotations
following indications of the OpenPose paper

verification_SL_Fields
======================
file which purpose is to verify that S and L fields are created properly
